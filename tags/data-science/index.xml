      <description>When I was a kid, I used to love playing with Lego. My brother and I built almost all kinds of stuff with Lego — animals, cars, houses, and even spaceships.

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What you do every day = who you are.&amp;rdquo;
 As an aspiring data scientist, I realized the importance of the habits that we do every day, both consciously and unconsciously. During that period of realization, I found one of the best self-mastery books — &amp;ldquo;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People&amp;rdquo; by Stephen R. Covey.
