      <description>When I was a kid, I used to love playing with Lego. My brother and I built almost all kinds of stuff with Lego — animals, cars, houses, and even spaceships. As time went on, our creations became more ambitious and realistic. There were also times when we could each have insisted that our Lego was our own, till we realized that pooling resources would eventually help us went further. We were growing up too, and as our playing became more sophisticated, we learned how to make better models.</description>

In this blog post, I want to share 5 analogies of data science to cooking which helped me understand the field better.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What you do every day = who you are.&amp;rdquo;
 As an aspiring data scientist, I realized the importance of the habits that we do every day, both consciously and unconsciously. During that period of realization, I found one of the best self-mastery books — &amp;quot;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People&amp;quot; by Stephen R. Covey. As the title suggests, the book elaborates on the 7 habits of the planet&#39;s highly effective people.</description>
