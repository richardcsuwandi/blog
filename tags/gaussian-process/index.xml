It is a non-parametric, Bayesian approach to machine learning that can be applied to supervised learning problems like regression and classification. Compared to other supervised learning algorithms, GP has several practical advantages: it can work well on small datasets and has the ability to provide uncertainty measurements on the predictions.
In this tutorial, I am going to demonstrate how to perform GP regression using GPyTorch.</description></item></channel></rss>
